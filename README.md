# Tech Test - GL Education

This tech test has been implemented in C# and .NET 6.0 using Visual Studio 2022 and tested on Windows 10.

## Running the API

After cloning this repository, you can run this project by opening a Powershell window inside the Calculator.WebService folder and running the ```dotnet run``` command.

The localhost port that displays in the Powershell window should match the URL in the Javascript for the API, if it does not, please amend the url in the js for the API to work.

You can then run the Calculator.Frontend project in Visual studio in order to see the frontend.

## Testing

Unit tests have been included as part of this project and can be found in the Calculator.Tests folder of the repository.

These can be run inside [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) using Test Explorer

## Other Notes

I notice this application was for a Full Stack developer, which I am not. I am backend developer with very limited knowledge of frontend technologies.

It is for this reason that the frontend is built in basic HTML, JS and CSS. So I could have a working concept of the backend code working.
